# Simulation via NVC

[NVC](https://www.nickg.me.uk/nvc/) is a free software VHDL compiler and simulator.

This scripts here use NVC to simulate JTAG Switcher.

To display the generated waveform, [gtkwave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) might be used.

To compile and simulate use

    ./01_nvc_run

To view the generated waveform use

    ./02_gtkwave
